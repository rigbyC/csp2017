<p>I am taking this course because I want to pursue a career in computer science. I also took this class because I like working on computers.</p>
<p>My personal interests are gaming, technology, and pokemon. I enjoy playing pokemon games but also other games as well. I am currently trying to save up enough money for a Nintendo 3DS XL. </p>
